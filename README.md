# Titan Network Shutdown Announcement ðŸš¨

Titan Network and Tokamak Bridge have been permanently shut down. To learn more, please read our [medium posting](https://medium.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-network-to-sunset-titan-b4471019c92).

## L1 claim

The L1 claim feature is available for users who have assets on Titan that haven't been withdrawn. Unlike the standard L2â†’L1 withdrawal, which requires a 7-day challenging period, L1 claim bypasses this process and allows users to claim their assets immediately. If you have any remaining assets on the Titan Network, you can directly claim them by following our [Withdrawal of Titan Assets Etherscan Guide](/l1forceclaim/EN/README.md).

## Finalizing Withdrawal Transactions

Any withdrawals that were previously initiated on Titan must still be finalized on L1 to receive the assets (these cannot be claimed using the L1 claim feature due to security issues). If you have any pending transactions that need to be finalized, please refer to our [Transaction Finalization Etherscan Guide](/withdrawFinalize/EN/README.md).
